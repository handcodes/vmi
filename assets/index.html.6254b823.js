But Nuxt is designed for building applications, while VuePress is more lightweight and focused on content-centric static sites.</p><h3 id="vitepress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vitepress" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VitePress</h3><p>VitePress is the little brother of VuePress. It&#39;s also created and maintained by our Vue.js team. It&#39;s even more lightweight and faster than VuePress. However, as a tradeoff, it&#39;s more opinionated and less configurable. For example, it does not support plugins. But VitePress is powerful enough to make your content online if you don&#39;t need advanced customizations.</p><p>It might not be an appropriate comparison, but you can take VuePress and VitePress as Laravel and Lumen.</p><h3 id="docsify-docute" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#docsify-docute" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Docsify / Docute</h3><p>Both are great projects and also Vue-powered. Except they are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don\u2019t care for SEO and don\u2019t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.</p><h3 id="hexo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hexo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hexo</h3><p>Hexo has been serving the Vue 2.x docs well. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of Vue for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo\u2019s Markdown rendering isn\u2019t the most flexible to configure.</p><h3 id="gitbook" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gitbook" aria-hidden="true">#</a> GitBook</h3><p>We\u2019ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not Vue based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.</p>',12);function O(R,W){const o=r("ExternalLinkIcon");return a(),i("div",null,[c,t("p",null,[u,t("a",l,[p,n(o)]),_]),f,g,t("p",null,[m,t("a",b,[w,n(o)]),y,t("a",k,[x,n(o)]),V]),t("p",null,[v,t("a",P,[j,n(o)]),B]),N,t("p",null,[T,t("a",I,[M,n(o)]),E,H,L,t("a",S,[G,n(o)]),A]),D])}var C=s(h,[["render",O],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{C as default};
